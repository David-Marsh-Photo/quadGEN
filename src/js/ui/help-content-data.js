      <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>quadGEN</strong> is a free, browser-based tool for generating and refining <code>.quad</code> files used with QuadToneRIP.  
        It supports LAB/LUT/ACV inputs, and an Edit Mode for precise, point-based curve edits.  
        Core features work fully offline; the optional AI assistant requires network access.
      </p>
      <p>
        quadGEN is designed for photographers, printmakers, and alt-process practitioners who create digital negatives or monochrome prints and need reliable tonal calibration.
      </p>

      <h3>What is QuadToneRIP?</h3>
      <p>
        QuadToneRIP (QTR) is a specialized RIP/driver for Epson printers focused on high-quality monochrome printing using multi-shade ink sets.  
        QTR uses <code>.quad</code> files to determine how much ink each printer channel lays down at every input level.  
        A <code>.quad</code> file contains 256-sample curves (0‚Äì100% input) for each channel supported by the printer (e.g., K, C, M, Y, LC, LM, LK, LLK, OR, GR, etc.).  
        When you select a <code>.quad</code> in your QTR workflow (often via Print-Tool on macOS), QTR reads these curves and applies the specified per-channel ink outputs to render your print.  
        quadGEN‚Äôs role is to help you build and refine those <code>.quad</code> curves so QTR can produce linear, predictable output.  
        See the <a href="https://www.quadtonerip.com/html/QTRoverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QuadToneRIP Overview</a> for more background.

      <h2 id="quickstart">Quick Start (Beta 3.1.5)</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Pick a printer layout</strong> and set conservative End limits (and any known density constants) before exporting anything.</li>
        <li><strong>Export a baseline linear ramp</strong> and stash it as your ‚Äúv0‚Äù reference in QuadToneRIP‚Äôs <code>quad</code> folder.</li>
        <li><strong>Print a step wedge</strong> through QTR/Print-Tool with that baseline curve‚Äîdisable color management entirely.</li>
        <li><strong>Measure the wedge</strong>, save the LAB <code>.txt</code> (0‚Äì100% GRAY, L* in range), and archive it under <code>data/</code>.</li>
        <li><strong>Load the measurement in quadGEN</strong>, confirm the normalization mode (perceptual L* by default; enable log-density for through-light workflows).</li>
        <li><strong>Review the global correction</strong> (chart, smoothing slider, auto-raise toasts, correction gain). Apply contrast intents only when required.</li>
        <li><strong>Optional Edit Mode touch-up</strong>: Recompute Smart key points from the plotted curve and adjust as needed; quadGEN auto-raises Ends when allowed.</li>
        <li><strong>Export the corrected <code>.quad</code></strong>, install it in QTR, reprint, remeasure, and iterate until tone stays linear.</li>

      <h2 id="features">Features (highlights)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Supports most Epson printers.</li>
        <li>Quickly export linear ramps with any single ink channel or combination.</li>
        <li>Channel table includes a <strong>Density</strong> column with studio presets (K/MK = 1.00, C = 0.21, LK = 0.054). Enter a value to lock a channel; leave it blank or set to <code>0</code> and quadGEN will regenerate that density automatically on the next LAB solve.</li>
        <li>Per-channel ink locks prevent accidental ink limit changes and clamp Smart curve edits to the stored limit until unlocked.</li>
        <li>Inputs: <code>.quad</code>, LAB <code>.txt</code>, LUT <code>.cube</code>, <code>.acv</code>, Manual L*.</li>
        <li>Apply intent remaps directly to a loaded <code>.quad</code> via ‚ÄúApply to Loaded Curve‚Äù.</li>
        <li>‚öôÔ∏è Options panel centralizes app-wide preferences (e.g., log-density normalization) without cluttering workflow panels.</li>
        <li>Correction overlay toggle draws a dashed red global target plus the purple linear baseline for identity checks. The light-blocking overlay shows a solid purple curve (with dashed reference when a comparison <code>.quad</code> is loaded), and the cumulative ink-load overlay sums every enabled channel with dashed/solid segments that flip to red once totals clear your warning threshold.</li>
        <li>Measurement spot markers (‚öôÔ∏è Options) line badges along a 70‚ÄØ% rail anchored to the unzoomed chart, showing green checks for LAB readings within ¬±1‚ÄØ% and colored arrows (red up for darken, blue down for lighten) with faint dots at the measured Y position‚Äîeven after zooming. Hover any badge to see the exact delta.</li>
                <li>Correction gain slider (üåê Global Correction) blends the identity curve with the measured correction (0‚Äì100‚ÄØ%); scrubbing pauses for ~150‚ÄØms to stay smooth, then the chart, spot markers, previews, and exported curves all refresh with the selected mix.</li>
        <li>Evenly spaced or irregular targets supported.</li>
        <li>Edit Mode: point-based edits at any time.</li>
        <li>Undo/Redo: full history of edits, LAB/LUT loads, global scaling, and per-channel slider changes.</li>
        <li>Recompute key points: simplify Smart Curves with tolerance/max-point controls.</li>
        <li>Graph zoom: use the +/‚àí control in the chart corner to rescale the Y-axis in 10% steps when working with low ink limits; when a channel peaks at 100% the chart keeps one highlight-inspection step and flattens anything above the displayed max while noting the clamp.</li>
        <li>Lab Tech: AI assistant for Q&amp;A and automation.</li>
        <li>Contrast intent: presets or custom targets; shows Œî vs target; endpoints fixed (use ink limits to change).</li>
        <li>Auto endpoint rolloff: optional white/black soft knees that detect early plateau and ease into the ink limit with a smooth shoulder/toe (3% proximity threshold).</li>
        <li>Import ACV/LUT as target: in the Custom Intent modal, load <code>.acv</code>/<code>.cube</code> as a target intent (not a correction); includes endpoint anchoring, monotonic enforcement, and blend.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="examples">Usage Examples</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Digital negatives: cyanotype, Pt/Pd, kallitype, polymer photogravure.</li>
        <li>Inkjet linearization: refine monochrome response for QTR printing.</li>
        <li>Curve editing: enter Edit Mode, nudge an ordinal, export.</li>
        <li>Conversion: load LAB/LUT/ACV and export <code>.quad</code>.</li>
        <li>Intent remap: load your reference linearized <code>.quad</code>, audition Gamma/Filmic presets, and bake a contrast variant directly.</li>
      </ul>

      <hr />

      <h2 id="best">Best Practices</h2>
      <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mb-3">Linearize your process once, keep that <code>.quad</code> as a reference, and branch from there. You can either bake an intent into the loaded reference with ‚ÄúApply Intent‚Äù, or leave the reference untouched and make the contrast move upstream in Photoshop‚Äîprinting through the linear reference yields the same result.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If your process requires a negative, invert it before printing with your <code>.quad</code>.</li>
        <li>Measure the final positive print (not the negative).</li>
        <li>Anchor endpoints and keep curves monotonic.</li>
        <li>Use ink limits to define deepest black (or cleanest white).</li>
        <li>Make incremental edits; use Undo/Redo liberally.</li>
        <li>Keep a ‚Äúreference‚Äù Linear intent <code>.quad</code>. You can bake contrast variants with ‚ÄúApply Intent‚Äù, or do the contrast move in Photoshop and print through the same linear reference‚Äîboth paths land on the same tone curve.</li>
        <li>Zoom the chart so low-limit runs fill the plot‚Äîtap +/‚àí in the lower-left to move in 10% steps, and the chart auto-expands again if you enable a higher ink limit later.</li>
      </ul>

      <hr />

      <h2 id="faq">Troubleshooting &amp; FAQ</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Offline use:</strong> Lab Tech is unavailable offline; manual functions work fully.</li>
        <li><strong>Curve orientation:</strong> quadGEN plots input % (X) vs ink output % (Y), origin = white. Other tools may use tone curves with origin = black.</li>
        <li><strong>ACV parsing:</strong> Photoshop <code>.acv</code> files now load directly from the file picker. The old <code>TypeError: t.includes is not a function</code> error is resolved‚Äîno manual text conversion is required.</li>
        <li><strong>Corrections:</strong> Upward curve = more ink (darker); downward = less ink (lighter). Example: raise mids if midtones are too light.</li>
        <li><strong>Full reset:</strong> Use your browser‚Äôs refresh/reload button to return quadGEN to a clean state.</li>

      <dl>
        <dt>Auto black limit</dt>
        <dd>Temporarily disabled while the rolloff detector is re-tuned. Previously applied a localized soft toe at the black end to preserve shadow separation.</dd>

        <dt>Auto white limit</dt>
        <dd>Temporarily disabled while the rolloff detector is re-tuned. Previously applied a localized soft shoulder at the white end to preserve highlight separation.</dd>

        <dt>Baked</dt>
        <dd>Indicates that a correction (global LUT, LAB table, or Smart curve) has been permanently folded into the current baseline curve. Baked data no longer re-applies on redraw; it updates ink-limit fields, exports, and history so further edits start from the corrected curve.</dd>

        <dt>Bell curve (ink channel)</dt>
        <dd>A channel profile that starts near 0‚ÄØ%, rises to a mid-curve apex, then tapers back toward 0‚ÄØ%. quadGEN highlights these highlight-heavy channels with a üîî badge in the channel table and exposes the detection via <code>window.getChannelShapeMeta()</code>.</dd>

        <dt>ACV (Photoshop Curves)</dt>
        <dd>Binary curve format used by Adobe Photoshop (<code>.acv</code>). In quadGEN: can be loaded as a global correction or per-channel adapter; anchors can seed editable Smart curve.</dd>

        <dt>Alternative process (Alt-process)</dt>
        <dd>Historic or non-traditional photographic printing methods such as platinum/palladium, cyanotype, kallitype, polymer photogravure, and gum bichromate. These processes often use digital negatives created through QuadToneRIP workflows, requiring precise tonal calibration that quadGEN provides.</dd>

        <dd>Mapping that adjusts output ink levels versus input to achieve a target response. In quadGEN, plotted as Y (output ink %) vs X (input %).</dd>

        <dt>Correction overlay</dt>
        <dd>Dashed global reference plotted on the chart, sampled from the active correction dataset, with a purple dashed linear baseline for identity comparison. Loading a secondary reference <code>.quad</code> remains on the roadmap; until that lands, the light-blocking overlay is the only one missing its reference trace. Enable the overlay from the Options panel toggle‚Äîno debug helpers required.</dd>

        <dt>Ink load overlay</dt>
        <dd>Summed ink-percentage trace across every enabled channel. Enable it from ‚öôÔ∏è Options ‚Üí ‚ÄúShow cumulative ink load overlay‚Äù to plot totals over the full chart height; dashed gray segments sit below the warning threshold, solid red segments flag overshoot, and tooltips report the live total with a ‚ö†Ô∏è marker whenever the threshold is exceeded.</dd>

        <dt>Measurement spot markers</dt>
        <dd>Optional overlay that plots each LAB measurement on the chart. Patches within ¬±1‚ÄØ% tolerance show a green check badge; out-of-tolerance points show an arrow (up = darken, down = lighten) labelled with the percent delta. Hover a badge to see the input %, measured L*, and recommended action.</dd>

        <dt>Light-blocking overlay</dt>
        <dd>Solid purple curve that estimates cumulative optical density across the active channels. Load a reference <code>.quad</code> file to display a dashed comparison curve alongside the current light-blocking overlay. Toggle it from ‚öôÔ∏è Options ‚Üí "Show light blocking overlay."</dd>

        <dt>Ink load overlay</dt>
        <dd>Plots the summed output percentage across all enabled channels so you can spot inputs where total coverage breaches your warning threshold. Toggle it via ‚öôÔ∏è Options ‚Üí "Show cumulative ink load overlay" and adjust the threshold field beneath the toggle; dashed gray segments sit under the limit while solid red segments highlight overshoots.</dd>

        <dt>Density</dt>
        <dd>Measure of how much light a material absorbs or blocks. In quadGEN we treat each density value as the normalized L* coverage ceiling an ink can provide; once a channel‚Äôs cumulative darkening reaches that ceiling (with a 0.5% buffer for measurement noise), the solver hands the remaining correction to higher-density inks. Enable the log-density toggle when you want corrections based on optical density (digital negatives, contact printing); leave it off to stay in L* for perceptual printer linearization. The channel table‚Äôs Density column lets you lock these ceilings (e.g., K/MK = 1.00, C = 0.21, LK = 0.054); leaving a field blank or zero prompts the solver to regenerate the value automatically. A coverage badge now sits beneath the Density input to show ‚Äúused / limit‚Äù and lights amber with a tooltip listing any clamped samples when the ceiling is hit.</dd>

        <dt>Density ladder</dt>
        <dd>Composite redistribution order (light inks ‚Üí dark inks) used by Normalized weighting. LK carries the highlight correction until it hits its buffered ceiling (‚âà1% headroom tolerance), then the solver hands the remaining delta to C, and only after C tops out does K contribute.</dd>

        <dt>Digital Negative</dt>
        <dd>A digitally created film negative used for alternative photographic processes like platinum/palladium printing, cyanotype, and silver gelatin contact printing. Created by inverting a positive digital image and printing it on transparent film with precise density control.</dd>

        <dt>EDN (Easy Digital Negatives)</dt>
        <dd><a href="http://www.easydigitalnegatives.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Workflow</a> created by Peter Mrhar to build correction LUTs for digital negatives. Export <code>.cube</code> LUTs from EDN for use as global/per-channel corrections in quadGEN.</dd>

        <dt>Edit Mode</dt>
        <dd>Gated state that enables key-point editing and shows overlays. Selected channel draws on top; unselected enabled channels dim.</dd>

        <dt>End (ink limit)</dt>
        <dd>Per-channel maximum ink level. Edits that require more ink can raise End when feasible; when End is effectively locked, edits that exceed it are blocked with status.</dd>

        <dt>Epson Media Installer</dt>
        <dd>Epson utility that downloads and installs ICC profiles and media settings for specific paper types on Epson printers. Provides paper thickness settings and media handling parameters needed for optimal print quality with third-party papers.</dd>

        <dt>Gaussian Weighted Correction</dt>
        <dd>LAB processing method that spreads each measurement's influence smoothly across inputs; reduces artifacts versus naive inversion techniques.</dd>

        <dt>Gamma value</dt>
        <dd>Numerical parameter that controls the shape of a power-law tone curve. In quadGEN's contrast intent presets: gamma < 1.0 (e.g., 0.85) lowers contrast by brightening shadows; gamma > 1.0 (e.g., 1.2, 1.6, 2.2) increases contrast by darkening shadows. Gamma = 1.0 produces a linear curve with no tonal adjustment.</dd>

        <dt>Global correction</dt>
        <dd>A correction that applies uniformly to all channels (e.g., LAB/LUT/ACV loaded as global data or computed from measurements).</dd>

        <dt>Global scale</dt>
        <dd>The batch control that multiplies every channel‚Äôs End value by the requested percent. quadGEN records a single undo action for global scaling, so one Undo reverts all affected channels together.</dd>

        <dt>Graph orientation</dt>
        <dd>quadGEN plots printer-space ink mapping with 0% = white (no ink) at the origin. Photoshop/other "tone" tools often use 0,0 = black.</dd>

        <dt>Image space</dt>
        <dd>Coordinate system where 0 represents black (shadow) and 100 represents white (highlight), matching how images are typically viewed and edited. Point (0,0) = black input produces black pixel output; point (100,100) = white input produces white pixel output. ACV files, LUTs, and most user input use image space conventions. quadGEN automatically converts image space data to printer space for internal processing and display.</dd>

        <dt>Ink set</dt>
        <dd>Collection of inks available in a printer, such as the standard CMYK inks or expanded sets like K, C, M, Y, LC, LM, LK, LLK for monochrome work. QuadToneRIP supports multi-shade ink sets that use multiple densities of the same color (e.g., Light Black, Light Light Black) for smoother tonal gradations.</dd>

        <dt>Input Level %</dt>
        <dd>X-axis value representing the input level (0‚Äì100%) in printer space; corresponds to the source tone step being mapped.</dd>

        <dt>Intent (Contrast Intent)</dt>
        <dd>A target tonal mapping the correction aims to match. Choose a preset (Linear, Soft/Hard gamma, Filmic, etc...) or define a custom target via sliders or pasted CSV/JSON. Intents affect Œî vs target and exported filename/comments (compact tag), but do not change measurement ingestion; endpoints (0% and 100%) remain fixed. To alter black/white points, adjust ink limits/end values.</dd>

        <dt>Interpolation</dt>
        <dd>Method to form a smooth curve between key points. quadGEN favors monotonic PCHIP for predictable, non-overshooting results.</dd>

        <dt>Endpoint rolloff (shoulder/toe)</dt>
        <dd>A smooth, monotone easing near the ends of the curve (white shoulder, black toe) that prevents a hard plateau and maintains step separation at the last few percent.</dd>

        <dt>Key point</dt>
        <dd>An editable control point of a Smart Curve. Identified by ordinal (1-based). Insert/adjust/delete supported; endpoints often guarded. Coordinates are defined in printer space with the origin at (0,0), where X = input % (0‚Äì100) and Y = output ink % (0‚Äì100).</dd>

        <dt>L* (L-star)</dt>
        <dd>Lightness component of the LAB color space, ranging from 0 (pure black) to 100 (pure white). quadGEN can linearize directly in L* (default) for perceptual prints, or convert to optical density when the log-density toggle is enabled.</dd>

        <dt>LAB data (<code>.txt</code>)</dt>
        <dd>Text file with measured L*, A*, B* (quadGEN expects GRAY and LAB columns). Used to compute or validate corrections.</dd>

        <dt>LUT (Look-Up Table)</dt>
        <dd>Data structure that maps input values to output values, used for color and tone transformations. quadGEN supports 1D and 3D <code>.cube</code> LUT files from tools like Easy Digital Negatives (EDN) and can extract neutral-axis corrections for linearization.</dd>

        <dt>Lab Tech</dt>
        <dd>The built-in assistant in quadGEN that can answer questions and perform actions (when networked). Optional; core editing/export features work offline.</dd>

        <dt>Log-density linearization</dt>
        <dd>Optional normalization mode that converts measured L* to optical density (‚àílog<sub>10</sub>(Y)) before building the correction curve. Recommended for digital negatives and other through-light workflows where equal density steps translate to equal exposure. Enable it from the Options panel‚Äôs ‚ÄúUse log-density for LAB / Manual measurements‚Äù toggle (also available inside the Manual L* modal).</dd>

        <dt>Linearization</dt>
        <dd>Process of adjusting printer output so that equal input steps (e.g., 0‚Äì100%) produce consistent tonal changes. quadGEN supports two normalizations: perceptual L* (default for direct prints) and log-density (optical) for through-light workflows. Both ingest measured L*, compare to the target curve, and generate a correction LUT that enforces a near-linear relationship between input values and visual tone.</dd>

        <dt>Linear ramp</dt>
        <dd>Identity mapping (input % = output %) used as a neutral baseline for tests/export and certain workflows.</dd>

        <dt>Max error %</dt>
        <dd>Used for Smart curve Key point calculation. The largest deviation allowed from data file before a new Key point will be generated. Lower this number to create a tight fitting curve with more Key points. Raise this number to create a smoother curve with fewer Key points.</dd>

        <dt>Max Points</dt>
        <dd>The upper limit on the number of Smart key points that quadGEN will generate when creating a Smart curve. Above this threshold, imported data (e.g., ACV/LUT/LAB) is simplified or interpolated to maintain performance and stability. Maximum is 25 points.</dd>

        <dt>Monotonic</dt>
        <dd>Property of a curve where values either never decrease (monotonic increasing) or never increase (monotonic decreasing) as you move along the X-axis. quadGEN enforces monotonic curves to ensure predictable printer behavior‚Äîno ink output reversals that could cause banding or unstable prints.</dd>

        <dt>Options panel</dt>
        <dd>The ‚öôÔ∏è Options modal opened from the toolbar beside Help. Centralizes quadGEN-wide preferences‚Äîincluding the log-density normalization toggle‚Äîso feature panels stay focused on their workflows.</dd>

        <dt>Reference curve</dt>
        <dd>A fully linearized <code>.quad</code> kept as the authoritative baseline for a printer/process. Branch contrast variants from this reference (Apply Intent or upstream edits) while preserving the trusted linear response.</dd>

        <dt>Open bite</dt>
        <dd>Unwanted etching or surface marking in intaglio printmaking, such as polymer photogravure, caused by insufficient plate hardening. It occurs when too much exposure light is blocked, preventing the formation of proper ink-holding recesses. Often linked to ink limits set too high, requiring careful calibration to avoid.</dd>

        <dt>Output Ink Level %</dt>
        <dd>Y-axis value representing the ink output (0‚Äì100%) after applying the curve and current End; higher values mean more ink (darker).</dd>

        <dt>Paper white</dt>
        <dd>The lightest tone that a specific paper can produce‚Äîessentially the color and brightness of the unprinted paper surface. In quadGEN workflows, paper white serves as the reference point for determining minimum ink limits and calibrating highlight reproduction.</dd>

        <dt>Patch</dt>
        <dd>Individual tonal step within a step wedge or calibration target. Each patch represents a specific input percentage (e.g., 0%, 10%, 20%) and is measured separately to build the correction curve. A typical 21-step target contains 21 patches at 5% intervals.</dd>

        <dt>Printer space</dt>
        <dd>Coordinate system where 0 represents white (no ink) and 100 represents maximum ink (black), matching how printers actually operate. Point (0,0) = white input produces no ink output (white); point (100,100) = black input produces maximum ink output (black). This is quadGEN's native coordinate system for all internal processing, curve display, and .quad file generation. Input data from image space sources (ACV, LUT, custom intents) is automatically transformed to printer space.</dd>

        <dt>Snapshot pair</dt>
        <dd>Undo entry created from a ‚ÄúBefore:‚Äù/‚ÄúAfter:‚Äù capture. quadGEN automatically rewinds to the matching ‚ÄúBefore:‚Äù snapshot, then stores both states together so redo replays the pair in the correct order.</dd>

        <dt>Simple Scaling correction</dt>
        <dd>Primary correction path that scales channel curves from the measured vs target ratios, redistributing overflow based on density reserves. Each pass clamps auto-lifts to +15‚ÄØ% per channel, keeps K/MK from auto-raising, and backfills any excess into darker reserves so highlights don‚Äôt double in one shot. The density solver is automatically integrated when multi-ink redistribution is required.</dd>

        <dt>Smart curve</dt>
        <dd>Adaptive curve model in quadGEN defined by editable key points and monotonic interpolation. Smart curves allow precise local edits while preserving smoothness and avoiding overshoot, enabling efficient linearization and correction workflows.</dd>

        <dt>Step wedge</dt>
        <dd>Test pattern with evenly spaced tonal steps from white to black, printed to measure printer response. Typically contains 10-25 patches at regular intervals (e.g., 0%, 10%, 20%...100%). After printing through QuadToneRIP, the wedge is measured with a colorimeter or spectrophotometer to generate LAB data for linearization in quadGEN. Often used interchangeably with "target."</dd>

        <dt>Target (21/25-step etc)</dt>
        <dd>Printable step-wedge target used for iterative calibration. Measure the print (e.g., with Color Muse 2 or Nix Spectro L), import LAB <code>.txt</code>, refine, and reprint. Often used interchangeably with "step wedge."</dd>

        <dt>Tone curve</dt>
        <dd>Graph showing the relationship between input tonal values and output tonal values, controlling how light and dark areas are reproduced. In quadGEN, tone curves are displayed in printer space (X = input %, Y = output ink %) and can be linear (no change) or shaped for specific contrast intents.</dd>
                    <dt>Spectrophotometer</dt>
        <dd>Measures full spectral reflectance for precise LAB calculations and deep-shadow accuracy. Ideal for alternative processes and professional calibration. Example: <a href="https://amzn.to/4msSLOv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nix Spectro L</a>.</dd>

<dt>Nix Spectro L</dt>
        <dd>Compact spectrophotometer capable of low-L* readings. Capture LAB data with the Nix app and import the <code>.txt</code> file into quadGEN. Ideal for alternative and darkroom processes. <a href="https://amzn.to/4msSLOv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Product link</a>.</dd>

                    <dt>P900</dt>
        <dd>Epson SureColor P900 17-inch photo printer (K,C,M,Y,LC,LM,LK,LLK,V,MK) often used for monochrome workflows with QuadToneRIP. <a href="https://amzn.to/42yGCQD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Product link</a>.</dd>

        <dt>PCHIP</dt>
        <dd>Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating Polynomial‚Äîa mathematical method for creating smooth curves between data points. Unlike other interpolation methods, PCHIP prevents overshooting and maintains monotonic behavior, making it ideal for photographic tone curves where predictable, artifact-free results are essential.</dd>

<dt>PoPS (Prints on Paper Studio)</dt>
        <dd><a href="https://printsonpaper.studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Collaborative printmaking studio</a> specializing in photogravure and digital pigment printing, offering artists a welcoming environment to create and edition fine art prints using innovative techniques. PoPS has developed contrast intent presets included in quadGEN for alternative photographic processes. Note: quadGEN is not affiliated with or part of Prints on Paper Studio.</dd>

        <dt>Print Tool</dt>
        <dd><a href="https://www.quadtonerip.com/html/QTRprinttool.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Utility application</a> for macOS that enables color-managed printing from TIFF files while bypassing standard print driver limitations. Commonly used with QuadToneRIP workflows for printing digital negatives and monochrome images.</dd>

        <dt>QuadToneRIP (QTR)</dt>
        <dd><a href="https://www.quadtonerip.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Specialized RIP/driver</a> for Epson printers designed for high-quality monochrome printing with multi-shade ink sets. QTR uses <code>.quad</code> files to control how much ink each channel lays down across the 0‚Äì100% input range, enabling precise tonal calibration and alternative process workflows such as digital negatives.</dd>

        <dt>RIP</dt>
        <dd>Raster Image Processor‚Äîsoftware that converts digital images into printer-specific instructions, controlling how ink is laid down on paper. RIPs like QuadToneRIP provide precise control over individual ink channels and support specialized workflows beyond standard printer drivers.</dd>

        <dt>Revert (to measurement)</dt>
        <dd>Buttons that return curves to the loaded measurement source for iteration. <strong>Per‚Äëchannel Revert</strong> clears Smart curves/points and re‚Äëenables that channel‚Äôs measurement (enabled only when measurement data is loaded for that channel). <strong>Global Revert</strong> clears Smart curves/points across all channels and re‚Äëenables the global measurement (enabled only when a global file is loaded and the global toggle is ON). Both actions are undoable.</dd>

        <dt>Recompute</dt>
        <dd>Button in Edit Mode that regenerates Smart curve key points for the selected channel from the currently plotted curve using the configured <em>Max error %</em> and <em>Max Points</em> settings‚Äîuseful for simplifying or refreshing an editable set from a loaded <code>.quad</code>.</dd>

      <h2>quadGEN Workflow</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide a concise, repeatable workflow to build and refine <code>.quad</code> curves for QuadToneRIP (QTR).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.quadtonerip.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QuadToneRIP</a> installed; know where your printer‚Äôs ‚Äúquad‚Äù folder is.</li>
        <li>Ability to print a step wedge/target via QTR (Print-Tool on macOS recommended).</li>
        <li>Optional (but recommended): <a href="https://amzn.to/45R8rof" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Color Muse 2</a> or <a href="https://amzn.to/4msSLOv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nix Spectro L</a> to capture LAB L*.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>1) Choose Printer</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>At the top of the page, select your Epson printer model.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>2) Export a starting <code>.quad</code></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>You can skip this step if you already have an existing <code>.quad</code> to refine. Otherwise, start with a single linear ramp of Black (K) ‚Äî or Matte Black (MK) if available ‚Äî using the default 100% ink limit.</li>
        <li>Install the <code>.quad</code> into QTR‚Äôs quad folder for your printer.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>3) Verify Ink Choice & Limits</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Digital negative processes</strong>: Find the lowest ink limit that still achieves paper white by printing a step target and determine the ink limit used at the first patch that matches your paper white.  Invert the target image in your editor before printing with your <code>.quad</code>. For example, if the first patch that matches your paper white occured on the 8th darkest patch of an evenly spaced 10 step negative (referring to the <i>positive</i> target image), you can use an ink limit of 80%</li>
        <li><strong>Positive processes (e.g., polymer photogravure)</strong>: Find the maximum ink limit that <em>does not</em> cause open bite by printing an open‚Äëbite target and increasing the ink limit until the first signs of open bite, then back off.</li>
        <li>Once you‚Äôve identified an ink limit, create a new .quad file with that limit and proceed to calibration.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>4) Print a Calibration Target</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Option A ‚Äî LAB workflow</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Use QTR/Print‚ÄëTool and the <code>.quad</code> from step 2/3 to print a 0‚Äì100% step wedge (or <a href="https://clayharmonblog.com/downloads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clay Harmon‚Äôs 21/25‚Äëstep target</a>).</li>
            <li>Ensure color management is OFF in Print‚ÄëTool.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Option B ‚Äî EDN workflow</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Visit <a href="http://www.easydigitalnegatives.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Easy Digital Negatives</a> and download the appropriate target file.</li>
            <li>Print the EDN target via QTR/Print‚ÄëTool with color management OFF, using the <code>.quad</code> from step 2/3.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>5) Calibration: Measure the Print</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Option A ‚Äî LAB workflow</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Set patch count</strong>: choose the number of patches/steps to match your printed target.</li>
            <li><strong>Enter Patch % (X)</strong>: if your target is not evenly spaced, type the input position for each row (0‚Äì100). If evenly spaced, keep the defaults.</li>
            <li><strong>Measure and enter L*</strong>: measure each printed patch with your device (e.g., <a href="https://amzn.to/45R8rof" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Color Muse 2</a> or <a href="https://amzn.to/4msSLOv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nix Spectro L</a>) and enter L* (0‚Äì100) in the matching row.</li>
            <li><strong>Apply or save</strong>: click ‚ÄúGenerate Correction‚Äù to apply immediately, or ‚ÄúSave as .txt‚Äù to export the entries for later reuse.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Option B ‚Äî EDN workflow</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>Follow the EDN instructions to scan and analyze your print result.</li>
            <li>Download the EDN-generated <code>.acv</code> or <code>.cube</code> file.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>6) Load Data into quadGEN</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Option A ‚Äî LAB workflow</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Load LAB (.txt)</strong>: If not already applied from the Manual L* Entry window, use the Load Data File in the Global Corrections panel to load your saved measurements.</li>
            <li><strong>Interpretation</strong>: Y = output ink % vs X = input %; Y = X is ‚Äúno correction‚Äù. Too dark at X ‚Üí dip below diagonal; too light at X ‚Üí rise above.</li>
            <li><strong>Edit Mode tip</strong>: If Edit Mode is already ON, quadGEN now reseeds Smart key points from the measurement as soon as the file loads so the plotted curve updates immediately.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Option B ‚Äî EDN workflow</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Load ACV/LUT</strong>: use the Load Data File in the Global Corrections panel to load the downloaded EDN <code>.acv</code> or <code>.cube</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Interpretation</strong>: same graph semantics ‚Äî Y = output ink %, X = input %; dips lighten, humps darken.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>7) Export Corrected <code>.quad</code></h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Export the corrected <code>.quad</code> for general use and archive it as your ‚Äúreference‚Äù Linear profile.</li>
        <li>Keep this reference untouched; branch contrast variants by either baking presets with <strong>Apply Intent</strong> (when no LAB data is loaded) or doing the contrast move upstream in Photoshop before printing through the reference. Both paths land on the same tonal response.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="helpEditModeSection">8) Enter Edit Mode for Fine Tuning (optional)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Overview:</strong> Edit Mode converts the selected channel into Smart key points so you can make precise, point-by-point adjustments while every other enabled channel dims for context. Toggle it off when you want to lock the curve.</li>
        <li><strong>Toggle & visibility:</strong> Enable Edit Mode in the Edit Curves panel to expose the Smart controls; the selected channel renders on top and only it shows numbered key-point markers.</li>
        <li><strong>Calculate points:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Max error %</strong>: Sets how closely the generated Smart points follow the underlying curve (lower = more points, tighter fit).</li>
            <li><strong>Max Points</strong>: Caps how many Smart points quadGEN will generate (2-21).</li>
            <li><strong>Recompute</strong>: Regenerates Smart key points from the currently plotted curve using the settings above‚Äîideal for simplifying dense data from LAB or <code>.quad</code> loads.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Editing tools:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>XY input</strong>: Type <code>X,Y</code> (Y is absolute after the channel End). The Up/Down nudges adjust absolute Y, and Left/Right nudges adjust X.</li>
            <li><strong>Point selection</strong>: Use the point selector arrows to step through Smart points in order; the label updates as you move.</li>
            <li><strong>Insert/Delete</strong>: Click the chart to insert at the current curve location. Deleting endpoints is blocked; use Undo if a change goes too far.</li>
            <li><strong>Undo / Redo</strong>: Every edit is logged in history, so you can step backwards or forwards as needed.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>9) Iterate Until Linear (optional)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Repeat from step 5 until corrections become negligible.</li>
        <li>There will be some noise in the measurements for both workflows. Expect diminishing returns on linearization.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>10) Choose a Contrast Intent (optional)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use the <strong>Intent</strong> dropdown in Global Correction to pick a preset (Linear, Soft, Hard, Filmic) or choose <strong>Enter Custom‚Ä¶</strong> to open the modal.</li>
        <li><strong>Custom</strong>: apply sliders (Gamma or Filmic‚Äëlike) or <strong>Paste CSV/JSON</strong> data; the parser auto-validates pasted text.</li>
        <li>Intents shape the target curve only; ingestion and reconstruction are unchanged. Endpoints (0% and 100%) remain fixed ‚Äî adjust ink limits/end values to move black/white points.</li>
        <li>When no LAB data is active, the <strong>Apply Intent</strong> button bakes the selected preset into the loaded <code>.quad</code>; use it to spin off contrast-specific variants directly from your reference.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Notes & Tips</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Keep curves smooth, avoid kinks near endpoints.</li>
        <li>Use the +/‚àí zoom control in the lower-left of the graph to blow up low ink-limit curves; the Y-axis labels reflect the displayed max and the chart auto-expands if a newly enabled channel exceeds it.</li>
        <li>For digital negatives, invert the image in your editor before printing with your <code>.quad</code>.</li>
      </ul>
