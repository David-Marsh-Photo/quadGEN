## Active task
scaling-state-ab-plan: Scope A/B rollout metrics and pending scaling-state tests
## What changed
- Added Playwright coverage for repeated intent application and fixed intent remap to reuse original curves, preventing compounding distortions
- Rebuilt bundle and re-ran intent, scaling-state, and smoke suites to confirm the fix
- Rollout plan + manual docs still reflect private deployment workflow
## Next steps
- Prepare final summary with updated changelog/test references and confirm readiness for release
