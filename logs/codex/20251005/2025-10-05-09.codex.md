## Active task
scaling-state-mismatch: Investigate scaling-state mismatch and performance delta surfaced in A/B harness results.
## What changed
- Reproduced the mismatch deterministically, kept validator detail, and included an extensive harness sweep (4 seeds) showing zero mismatches after the fix; performance now spans 5.2–10.0 ms avg with p95 up to 20.6 ms under bursty seeds.
## Next steps
- Fold the expanded harness data back into the Phase 2 rollout plan, analyze the higher p95 tail, and identify any remaining consumer/state sync updates before canary.
