## Active task
phase2-next-steps — Planning remaining declarative scaling rollout work
## What changed
- Checked Phase 2 checklist to reflect completed dual-read prep (state slice, dual-write, flag toggles, legacy fallbacks) and recorded outstanding validation/history items
- Added a "Phase 2 – Next Actions" section outlining parity validation, history snapshots, consumer audit, and A/B/perf benchmarks
- Trimmed the scaling-state Playwright spec diagnostics and synchronized via subscription wait; gated runtime logging behind `DEBUG_LOGS`
- Rebuilt the bundle and reran the dual-read Playwright spec (still green, warning about intent remap recursion persists)
## Next steps
- Summarize the execution plan for validation/history/consumer audit tasks and queue implementation work
## Artifacts
- docs/features/checklists/PHASE_2_DECLARATIVE_STATE.md
- docs/features/SCALING_IMPROVEMENT_PLANS.md
- src/js/ui/event-handlers.js
- tests/e2e/scaling-state-dualread.spec.ts
## Blockers
- Intent remap console warning (`RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded`) surfaces during Playwright run; needs follow-up triage
