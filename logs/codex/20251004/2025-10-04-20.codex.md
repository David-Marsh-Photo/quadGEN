## Active task
phase2-planning — Phase 2 pre-work complete (selectors/batching/computed/history, dual-write ready)
## What changed
- State manager now has memoized selectors, nested batching, computed property APIs, and v2 history snapshots (with migration helpers)
- Scaling utilities dual-write to the state manager when `__USE_SCALING_STATE` is enabled; new Vitest suite exercises the bridge
- Combined suites (selectors/batch/computed/history/scaling dual-write) all pass (22 tests)
## Next steps
- Summarize Phase 2 readiness and outline next implementation milestones (dual-read consumers, etc.)
