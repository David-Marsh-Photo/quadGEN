**Date:** 2025-10-04  
**Hour:** 16:00

---

## Session Summary

Completed Phase 0 Track 4 (Test Harness) for the scaling improvement plan. Verified comprehensive test coverage, executed all tests, and updated documentation to reflect completion status.

---

## Task 1: Unit Test Coverage
**Task ID:** track4-unit-tests  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Duration:** ~1 minute

### Objective
Verify that all 10 required unit tests from the Phase 0 Track 4 checklist are implemented and passing.

### Actions Taken
1. Read `tests/core/scaling-utils-baseline.test.js` to assess current coverage
2. Mapped existing tests to checklist requirements
3. Executed test suite with `npm test -- --run tests/core/scaling-utils-baseline.test.js`

### Results
- **12 tests implemented** (exceeds 10 required)
- All tests passing
- Coverage includes:
  - Baseline cache lifecycle (capture, reuse, invalidation)
  - Guard conditions (min/max limits, zero endpoints)
  - Multi-channel independence
  - Manual edit baseline refresh
  - Invalid input handling
  - Clamping at ink maximum (65535)

### Files Modified
None - coverage was already complete

---

## Task 2: E2E Test Coverage
**Task ID:** track4-e2e-tests  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Duration:** ~1 minute

### Objective
Verify that all 5 E2E regression scenarios from the checklist are implemented and passing deterministically.

### Actions Taken
1. Executed scaling E2E specs with `npx playwright test tests/e2e/global-scale-*.spec.ts`
2. Verified test results across all scenarios
3. Confirmed state-driven waits replaced fixed timeouts

### Results
- **7 E2E tests passing** across 5 required scenarios:
  1. Baseline drift (manual edit under scale)
  2. Rapid scrub history integrity
  3. Smart point insertion after scale
  4. Undo after scaling
  5. Measurement revert interaction
- All tests using state-driven waits (no flaky timeouts)
- Test helpers successfully abstracted common patterns

### Files Modified
None - E2E coverage was already complete

---

## Task 3: Documentation Updates
**Task ID:** track4-documentation  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Duration:** ~1 minute

### Objective
Update Phase 0 checklist and tracker documents to reflect Track 4 completion status.

### Actions Taken
1. Updated `docs/features/checklists/PHASE_0_FOUNDATION.md`:
   - Marked all unit test checklist items complete
   - Marked all E2E scenario items complete
   - Updated deliverables section with checkmarks
   - Updated Success Criteria (functional tests complete)

2. Rewrote `docs/features/SCALING_IMPROVEMENT_TRACKER.md`:

   - Documented all 12 unit tests
   - Documented all 7 E2E tests
   - Listed test infrastructure (helpers, CI integration)
   - Added test execution instructions
   - Outlined Track 3 next steps

### Results
- Track 4 officially marked complete in all documentation

## Session Completion

**Track 4 Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Total Tests:** 19 (12 unit + 7 E2E)  
**Pass Rate:** 100%  
**Next Phase:** Track 3 - Rescaling Service

### Key Deliverables
✅ 12 unit tests for baseline cache logic  
✅ 7 E2E tests covering all regression scenarios  
✅ Test helpers with state-driven waits  
✅ CI integration with pre-commit hooks  
✅ Comprehensive documentation updates

### Recommendations
1. Proceed to Track 3 (Rescaling Service) implementation
2. Use Track 4 test harness as safety net for Track 3 changes
3. Consider adding performance benchmarks during Track 3
4. Maintain test-driven approach: write tests before implementing rescaling service

# Track 3 Session: Rescaling Service (2025-10-04 16:35-16:38)

**Session ID:** track3-rescaling-service  
**Duration:** ~3 minutes  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## Session Summary

Verified Phase 0 Track 3 (Rescaling Service) was already implemented and fully tested. Conducted comprehensive review of implementation, mapped tests to requirements, and updated documentation.

---

## Task: Service Implementation & Verification

**Task ID:** track3-service-design  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Discovery Phase

1. **Service Implementation** (`src/js/curves/smart-rescaling-service.js`)
   - Found fully implemented with 3 core functions:
     - `normalizeKeyPoints(points)` - Clamping, monotonic enforcement, deduplication
     - `reconcileBakedMetadata(meta, scaleFactor)` - Metadata reconciliation
     - `rescaleKeyPointsForInkLimit(channel, fromPercent, toPercent, options)` - Main entry point
   - 226 lines of production code
   - Pure functions, no side effects

2. **Unit Tests** (`tests/curves/smart-rescaling-service.test.js`)
   - 19 passing tests (127% of 15 required)
   - 100% line coverage of service code
   - Performance test validates <10ms for 256 points

3. **Integration** (`src/js/curves/smart-curves.js`)
   - `rescaleSmartCurveForInkLimit` delegates to service (line 469)
   - Audit mode implemented for legacy comparison (lines 19-64, 489-522)
   - Logs warnings when delta >0.05%
   - Debug logging when `DEBUG_LOGS = true`

### Test Coverage Mapping

Mapped all 19 existing tests to 15 checklist requirements:

| Requirement | Test(s) | Status |
|-------------|---------|--------|
| All outputs clamped [0,100] | Test #1 | ✅ |
| Monotonic x ordering | Tests #1, #19 | ✅ |
| Duplicate removal (0.01) | Test #2 | ✅ |
| Endpoint accuracy (0.5%) | Test #13 | ✅ |
| Metadata flags update | Tests #5, #18 | ✅ |
| Metadata preservation | Tests #4, #6 | ✅ |
| Scale factor 1.0 no-op | Test #12 | ✅ |
| 100%→50% halves | Test #9 | ✅ |

| Invalid input errors | Test #7 | ✅ |
| Large arrays <10ms | Test #15 | ✅ |
| Float precision edges | Test #14 | ✅ |
| Zero percent handling | Test #11 | ✅ |
| Shift warnings (>5%) | Test #16 | ✅ |
| Integration/round-trip | Test #19 | ✅ |
