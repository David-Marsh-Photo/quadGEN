# Scaling Improvement Implementation Checklists

This directory contains comprehensive, phase-by-phase checklists for implementing the scaling system improvements outlined in [SCALING_IMPROVEMENT_AUDIT.md](../SCALING_IMPROVEMENT_AUDIT.md).

---

## Available Checklists

### ðŸ“‹ [PHASE_0_FOUNDATION.md](PHASE_0_FOUNDATION.md)
**Duration:** Weeks 1-3 | **Risk:** ðŸŸ¢ Low | **Tracks:** 3 + 4

**Start here!** Foundation phase establishes safety net and fixes isolated bugs.

**Contents:**
- **Track 4 (Test Harness):** 20+ unit tests, 5 E2E scenarios, state-driven waits
- **Track 3 (Rescaling Service):** Normalize, metadata reconciliation, 15+ tests
- Success criteria, deliverables, release checklist, rollback plan
- Sign-off sections for tracking completion

**Key Deliverables:**
- Comprehensive test suite (baseline cache, rescaling service)
- CI gate blocks merges if scaling tests fail
- Smart curve rescaling is deterministic and well-tested

---

### ðŸ“‹ [PHASE_1_ORCHESTRATOR.md](PHASE_1_ORCHESTRATOR.md)
**Duration:** Weeks 1-5 (including pre-work) | **Risk:** ðŸ”´ High | **Track:** 1

**Choose this if:** Scaling is isolated priority, no plans for state-manager upgrades

**Contents:**
- **Pre-work (4 days):** History transaction API (begin/commit/rollback)
- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2):** Build parallel coordinator system with feature flags
- **Phase 2 (Week 3):** Migrate low-traffic paths (AI commands, programmatic calls)
- **Phase 3 (Week 4):** Migrate high-traffic UI (blur/enter/arrow keys)
- **Phase 4 (Week 5):** Remove legacy code, deprecate old functions
- Complete testing, performance benchmarks, A/B testing plan

**Key Infrastructure Cost:** +4-7 days for history transaction support

**Key Deliverables:**
- ScalingCoordinator class with queue and transaction management
- Zero baseline cache drift (1000+ operations tested)
- Undo/redo works atomically (one scale = one undo entry)

---

### ðŸ“‹ [PHASE_2_DECLARATIVE_STATE.md](PHASE_2_DECLARATIVE_STATE.md)
**Duration:** Weeks 1-5 (including pre-work) | **Risk:** ðŸŸ¡ Medium-High | **Track:** 2

**Choose this if:** State-manager improvements benefit multiple features beyond scaling

**Contents:**
- **Pre-work (10 days):** State-manager upgrades (memoization, batching, computed properties, schema versioning)
- **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2):** Dual-write pattern (state + globals in sync)
- **Phase 2 (Week 3):** Dual-read pattern (consumers migrate to state)
- **Phase 3 (Week 4):** Remove globals (state becomes source of truth)
- **Phase 4 (Week 5):** Clean history migration (remove v1 snapshot support)
- Validation at each step (assert state == globals)

**Key Infrastructure Cost:** +7-12 days for state-manager foundation work

**Key Deliverables:**
- State-manager with memoization, batching, computed properties
- Scaling state slice: globalPercent, baselines, isActive, maxAllowed
- Schema versioning for history snapshots (v1â†’v2 migration)
- Zero state desync bugs (1000+ operations validated)

## How to Use These Checklists

### 1. **Choose Your Path**
- **Start with Phase 0** (Foundation) - Always do this first! Low risk, high value.
- **Then choose Phase 1 OR Phase 2** (Orchestrator vs. Declarative State) based on:
  - Infrastructure costs (Track 1 = +4-7 days, Track 2 = +7-12 days)
  - Future benefits (Track 1 isolated to scaling, Track 2 improves all state management)
  - Team capacity for state-manager overhaul

### 2. **Track Progress**
- Open the checklist markdown file
- Check off `[ ]` items as you complete them
- Use sign-off sections at end of each phase
- Update dates: "Phase X Start Date" and "Phase X Completion Date"

### 3. **Follow the Structure**
Each checklist includes:
- âœ… **Pre-work:** Infrastructure upgrades required before starting
- âœ… **Phased Migration:** Step-by-step dual-path implementation (old + new coexist)
- âœ… **Testing:** Unit tests, integration tests, E2E scenarios, performance benchmarks
- âœ… **Deliverables:** What must be completed to move to next phase
- âœ… **Success Criteria:** Functional, performance, and quality gates
- âœ… **Release Checklist:** CHANGELOG, VERSION_HISTORY, build, regression matrix
- âœ… **Rollback Plan:** How to revert if issues arise

### 4. **Validation Gates**
Don't skip validation! Each phase includes:
- Unit test coverage thresholds
- E2E test pass rates (consecutive runs)
- Performance benchmarks (latency p95)
- A/B testing results (canary â†’ 50% â†’ 100%)
- Manual testing on production-like datasets

### 5. **Sign-off Requirements**
Each phase ends with:
- **Phase X Start Date:** _______________
- **Phase X Completion Date:** _______________
- **Sign-off:** _______________ (Team Lead / Tech Lead)

Get formal approval before proceeding to next phase!

## Recommended Order

```
Phase 0 (Foundation) â†’ Always do first! âœ…
    â†“
Choose one:
    â”œâ”€â†’ Phase 1 (Orchestrator) â†’ If scaling-only priority
    â””â”€â†’ Phase 2 (Declarative State) â†’ If state-mgr helps other features
```

**Timeline:**
- Phase 0: 2-3 weeks (Tracks 3+4)
- Phase 1: 3.5-4.5 weeks (Track 1)
- Phase 2: 3.5-5 weeks (Track 2)

**Total:** 5.5-8 weeks for complete scaling system overhaul

## Tips for Success

1. **Don't underestimate pre-work:** State-manager upgrades (Track 2) and history transactions (Track 1) take longer than you think. Budget extra time!

2. **Use feature flags religiously:** Both tracks use dual-path patterns. Always have a kill switch to revert to legacy behavior.

3. **Validate constantly:** Assert state == globals (Track 2) or coordinator == legacy (Track 1) after every operation during migration.

4. **Test at each phase:** Don't batch testing until the end. Each phase has specific test requirements for a reason.

5. **Document as you go:** Update CHANGELOG.md, VERSION_HISTORY, and architecture docs incrementally. Don't defer to release day.

6. **Celebrate milestones:** Each phase completion is a big deal. Acknowledge progress with team!
