# Phase 1: Orchestrator Refactor (Track 1) - Checklist

**Duration:** Weeks 1-5 (including pre-work)
**Risk Level:** ðŸ”´ High
**Goal:** Address baseline cache drift via queue-based orchestration

---

## Pre-work (Week 0: Days 1-4)

### Add Transaction Support to History Manager
- [x] Design transaction API
  - `history.beginTransaction(description: string): TransactionId`
  - `history.commit(transactionId: TransactionId): void`
  - `history.rollback(transactionId: TransactionId): void`
- [x] Implement transaction state tracking
  - Active transaction ID (null if none)
  - Pending actions buffer (collected during transaction)
  - Nesting depth counter (prevent nested transactions)
- [x] Update `recordChannelAction` to buffer during transactions
  - Check if transaction active
  - If yes: push to buffer, don't record to history yet
  - If no: record immediately (existing behavior)
- [x] Implement `commit()` logic
  - Flush buffer as single batch action
  - Clear transaction state
  - Trigger history update event
- [x] Implement `rollback()` logic
  - Discard buffer contents
  - Restore state to pre-transaction snapshot
  - Clear transaction state
- [x] Add transaction nesting guards
  - Throw error if `beginTransaction()` called during active transaction
  - Log warning if transaction not committed within 5 seconds
- [x] Write unit tests for transaction API (10+ cases)
  - Begin â†’ commit â†’ undo (single batch entry)
  - Begin â†’ rollback â†’ undo (no entry recorded)
  - Multiple actions in transaction (all atomic)
  - Rollback restores original state
  - Nested transaction throws error
- [x] Document transaction API in `src/js/core/history-manager.js` JSDoc
- [ ] Capture baseline scaling + undo/redo snapshots before coordinator work
  - Throwaway Playwright script exercises current scale â†’ undo â†’ redo flows
  - Save serialized channel state + console output artifacts for later parity checks
  - Store artifacts under `artifacts/scaling-baseline/` (ignored in repo if desired)

---

## Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2: Build Parallel System)

### Create Scaling Coordinator Module
- [x] Create `src/js/core/scaling-coordinator.js`
- [x] Implement `ScalingCoordinator` class
  - Constructor: Initialize queue, processing flag, history reference
  - `async scale(percent, source, options)`: Queue entry point
  - `async processQueue()`: Main processing loop
  - `async executeScaleOperation(op)`: Single operation handler
- [x] Implement queue data structure
  - Array of operation objects: `{ type, percent, source, timestamp, resolve, reject }`
  - FIFO ordering (oldest first)
  - Priority levels: 'high' (immediate), 'normal' (debounced)
- [x] Implement processing logic
  - Check if already processing (prevent re-entry)
  - Pop next operation from queue
  - Begin history transaction
  - Call `scaleChannelEndsByPercent()`
  - Wait for Smart curve rescaling to complete
  - Wait for chart update to complete
  - Commit history transaction
  - Resolve promise
  - Process next operation (recursive)
- [x] Add error handling
  - Catch errors during operation
  - Rollback history transaction
  - Reject promise with error
  - Continue processing queue (don't block on failure)
- [x] Add debug logging (if `DEBUG_LOGS = true`)
  - Queue length on each operation
  - Processing time per operation
  - Transaction IDs
- [x] Expose coordinator telemetry on `window.scalingCoordinator.debug`
  - Track max queue length, average processing time, retry counts
  - Include quick `dumpMetrics()` helper for canary reviews
  - Document usage in coordinator module comments

### Integrate with Event Handlers
- [x] Update `src/js/ui/event-handlers.js`
- [x] Add feature flag check in `commitScaleAll()`
  ```javascript
  if (window.__USE_SCALING_COORDINATOR) {
    scalingCoordinator.scale(parsed, 'ui').then(result => {
      showStatus(result.message);
    });
  } else {
    applyGlobalScaleCore(parsed); // Legacy path
  }
  ```
- [x] Import `scalingCoordinator` singleton at top of file
- [x] Initialize coordinator in `initializeEventHandlers()`
- [x] Add coordinator to debug registry (`window.scalingCoordinator`)

### Feature Flag Infrastructure
- [x] Add `window.__USE_SCALING_COORDINATOR = false` in `src/js/core/state.js`
- [x] Add toggle function: `window.enableScalingCoordinator(boolean)`
  - Set flag value
  - Log message to console
  - Optionally reload UI bindings
- [x] Document flag in `CLAUDE.md` debug section

### Unit Tests for Coordinator
- [x] Test: Single scale operation (100% â†’ 80%)
- [x] Test: Multiple sequential operations (100 â†’ 80 â†’ 60 â†’ 100)
- [x] Test: Queue ordering (FIFO, oldest processed first)
- [x] Test: Error handling (operation fails, queue continues)
- [x] Test: Transaction boundaries (one operation = one undo entry)
- [x] Test: Promise resolution (caller receives result)
- [x] Test: Promise rejection (caller receives error)
- [x] Test: High priority operations (bypass debounce)
- [x] Test: Concurrent scale requests (queued, not parallel)
- [x] Test: Queue drain on disable (no in-flight ops lost)
- [x] **Total: 10+ unit tests**

### Integration Tests (Coordinator + Legacy Comparison)
- [ ] Test: Compare coordinator vs. legacy on 1000 random operations
  - Generate random scale values (1-1000%)
  - Run with flag ON and OFF
  - Assert final state identical
  - Document any divergence as bug
- [ ] Test: Coordinator with Smart curves active
  - Enable Edit Mode
  - Scale via coordinator
  - Verify key points rescaled correctly
- [ ] Test: Coordinator with undo/redo
  - Scale â†’ undo â†’ redo
  - Verify state transitions correct
  - Check history stack depth (one entry per scale)

### Deliverables (Phase 1)
- [x] **scaling-coordinator.js** module (200-300 lines)
- [x] **History transaction API** working (5+ tests passing)
- [x] **Feature flag** toggles coordinator on/off
- [x] **10+ unit tests** for coordinator (all passing)
- [ ] **Integration tests** show parity with legacy (1000 ops)

## Phase 2 (Week 3: Migrate Low-Traffic Paths)

### Migrate AI Commands
- [ ] Update `src/js/ai/ai-actions.js`
- [ ] Remove feature flag check (always use coordinator for AI)
  ```javascript
  scale_channel_ends_by_percent({ scalePercent }) {
    return scalingCoordinator.scale(scalePercent, 'ai');
  }
  ```
- [ ] Update other AI scaling functions if any
- [ ] Add coordinator to Lab Tech context (expose via `window`)

### Migrate Programmatic Calls
- [ ] Audit all direct calls to `scaleChannelEndsByPercent` via grep
- [ ] Update each call site to use coordinator
- [ ] Leave UI event handlers on legacy (defer to Phase 3)

### Testing
- [ ] Run AI integration tests (Track 4 harness)
  - Test: `scale_channel_ends_by_percent` via Lab Tech
  - Test: Undo after AI scale
  - Test: AI scale during active user scale (queued correctly)
- [ ] Run full E2E suite with AI path on coordinator
- [ ] Verify no regressions in AI command behavior

### Deliverables (Phase 2)
- [ ] **AI commands** route through coordinator (no flag)
- [ ] **Programmatic calls** route through coordinator
- [ ] **UI handlers** still on legacy (high-traffic deferred)
- [ ] **AI integration tests** pass (all scenarios)

---

## Phase 3 (Week 4: Migrate High-Traffic UI Paths)

### Migrate Blur/Enter Handlers
- [ ] Update `commitScaleAll()` in `event-handlers.js`
- [ ] Remove feature flag check (always use coordinator)
  ```javascript
  function commitScaleAll(raw, immediate = false) {
    scalingCoordinator.scale(parsed, 'ui', {
      priority: immediate ? 'high' : 'normal'
    });
  }
  ```
- [ ] Keep legacy functions as private (not exported, not called)

### Migrate Arrow Key Handler
- [ ] Update arrow key timeout logic
  ```javascript
  setTimeout(() => {
    scalingCoordinator.scale(elements.scaleAllInput.value, 'ui');
  }, 0);
  ```

### Migrate Real-Time Input Handler
- [ ] Update input event debounce
  ```javascript
  inputDebounceTimer = setTimeout(() => {
    scalingCoordinator.scale(value, 'ui', { priority: 'normal' });
  }, 150);
  ```

### A/B Testing
- [ ] Deploy to staging with flag OFF (control group)
- [ ] Enable flag for 10% of operations (canary test)
- [ ] Monitor for 24 hours:
  - Coordinator failures per minute (`scalingCoordinator.metrics.failed`) stay at 0
  - Queue length/latency (`getDebugInfo().maxQueueLength`, `lastDurationMs`) remain within targets (max queue â‰¤ 5, p95 < 50â€¯ms)
  - UI telemetry (existing status-service logs) shows no scale errors
- [ ] Increase to 50% if canary passes
- [ ] Monitor for 48 hours with same metrics
- [ ] Enable for 100% if no issues; keep legacy fallbacks accessible for one release cycle

### Performance Benchmarks
- [ ] Measure input latency with Playwright
  - Simulate rapid typing in scale input
  - Measure time from keypress to chart update
  - Assert p95 <50ms (coordinator overhead <5ms)
- [ ] Measure queue processing time
  - 100 operations queued at once
  - Time from first to last completion
  - Assert <2 seconds total (20ms avg per op)

### Deliverables (Phase 3)
- [ ] **All UI handlers** route through coordinator
- [ ] **Legacy functions** private (not called)
- [ ] **A/B test results** documented (50%+ canary passed)
- [ ] **Performance benchmarks** meet targets (p95 <50ms)

### Mark Legacy Functions as Deprecated
- [ ] Update `scaling-utils.js`
  ```javascript
  export function applyGlobalScale(rawPercent) {
    throw new Error('applyGlobalScale deprecated - use scalingCoordinator.scale()');
  }
  ```
- [ ] Update `scaleChannelEndsByPercent` JSDoc
  - Add `@deprecated Use scalingCoordinator.scale() instead`
- [ ] Search codebase for any remaining direct calls
  - Should find zero (all migrated)

### Remove Feature Flags
- [ ] Delete `window.__USE_SCALING_COORDINATOR` from state.js
- [ ] Remove flag checks from event-handlers.js
