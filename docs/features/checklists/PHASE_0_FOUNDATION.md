## Track 4: Test Harness (Week 1-2)

### Unit Tests for Baseline Cache Logic
- [x] Write test: Scale to 80% â†’ returns to 100% â†’ baseline cache cleared
- [x] Write test: Scale to 120% â†’ channel at 65535 limit â†’ clamping works
- [x] Write test: Scale to 50% â†’ manual channel edit â†’ scale to 80% â†’ no double-scaling
- [x] Write test: Baseline cache guards at max limit (currentEnd >= 65535)
- [x] Write test: Baseline cache guards at min limit (currentEnd <= 0)

- [x] **Total: 12 unit tests covering all baseline cache behavior** (`tests/core/scaling-utils-baseline.test.js`)

### Baseline Artifacts (Pre-change)
- [x] Capture current scaling + undo/redo behavior before harness refactors
  - Use a disposable Playwright script to exercise each regression scenario
  - Save serialized channel state + console output under `artifacts/scaling-baseline/`
  - Keep artifact hashes in tracker so parity checks can diff against the same source later

-### E2E Scenarios for Regression Vectors
- [x] **Scenario 1 (Baseline Cache Drift):** Scale to 80% â†’ Edit channel to 90% â†’ Scale to 100%
  - Verify baseline restored correctly
  - Check no accumulated rounding errors
  - Assert end values match expected
- [x] **Scenario 2 (Real-Time Input Bypass):** Rapid scrub 100â†’50â†’100 via slider
  - Verify history stack coherence
  - Undo twice should restore to initial state
  - Check no missed intermediate states
- [x] **Scenario 3 (Smart Curve Interaction):** Edit Mode active â†’ Scale to 80% â†’ Insert key point
  - Verify key points preserve absolute chart positions
  - Check no double-scaling of endpoints
  - Assert metadata flags remain consistent
- [x] **Scenario 4 (Undo After Scaling):** Scale to 80% â†’ Undo
  - Verify state returns to 100%
  - Check baseline cache cleared
  - Assert all channels restored to original values
- [x] **Scenario 5 (Revert Interaction):** Scale to 80% â†’ Load measurement â†’ Revert â†’ Scale to 100%
  - Verify measurement state preserved
  - Check no LAB data contamination
  - Assert baseline cache independent of revert

### Replace Fixed Timeouts with State-Driven Waits

- [x] Update `edit-mode-keypoint-scaling.spec.ts` line 113: Replace timeout with curve state check
- [x] Add helper: `waitForScaleComplete(page, expectedPercent)` - waits for `getCurrentScale() === expectedPercent`
- [x] Add helper: `captureScalingState(page)` - snapshots scale, baselines, channel ends
- [x] Add helper: `compareScalingStates(before, after)` - diffs two state snapshots
- [x] Document test helpers in `tests/utils/scaling-test-helpers.ts`

### CI Integration
- [x] Add scaling tests to CI gate (must pass to merge)
- [x] Configure Playwright to run scaling specs in parallel
- [x] Set timeout thresholds (fail if any test >30s)
