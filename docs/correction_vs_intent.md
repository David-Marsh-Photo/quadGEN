Choose a target tonal intent (the target you want to aim for if not the default Linear). This does not apply a correction. To apply ACV/LUT as a correction, use Global Corrections → Load Data File.

Confused about the difference between applying a correction vs. an intent? Here is a metaphor using a symphony orchestra.

##Correction = the tuning process.
Before the orchestra plays, each instrument is tuned to a linear, evenly spaced scale of notes so that pitches are objectively accurate. This provides a neutral, consistent foundation, much like linearizing a printer in L*.


##Intent = the interpretation chosen by the conductor.
Once tuned, the orchestra can perform a written piece in different ways, much like choosing a Linear,Filmic,Perceptual, etc intent.

- literalist = a literal performance, playing the score exactly as notated, without taking any liberties.
- Rubato = literally “stolen time”; the flexible stretching/compressing of tempo to heighten expression.
- Marcato = accented, marked style; adds weight and emphasis.

Changing the intent will adjust how the printed image appears, but it is still based on an underlying calibration that was *tuned* to match a linear target response first.
